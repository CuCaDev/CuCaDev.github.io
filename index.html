<h2 style="color:tomato;text-align:center;">You have found the most <i>magical</i> place on the internet</h2>
  
<p>I am so very happy to see you here. The internet can be a big, scary place, but know that you have arrived in a safe harbour. Seek comfort in the digital embrace of my webpage,
and gently wipe your tear-stained cheeks, for tonight you shall fear no political debate, unsolicited pictures of genetalia or pornography featuring beloved cartoon characters.</p>

<p style="background-color:tomato;">So, sit down and relax, and let me show you around.</p>
  
<p>Also,
